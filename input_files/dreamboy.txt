Am I the boy you dreamed of?
Living in your subconscious, oh
Do you believe in love?
And is it because of me?
Yeah, if it's up to me
Am I the boy you dreamed of?
Living in your subconscious, oh
Do you believe in love?
And is it because of me?
Yeah, if it's up to me
Say it all

Build your expectations
Saturated and inflated
'Cause I was born to be your favorite
Make me complicated
I'm modern and I'm dated
Because I was born to be your favorite

Pick my pieces
Overjoyed
Never leave your
Heart destroyed
I'm your boy
Custom-made
Your beloved getaway
I'm your favorite holiday
You'll never be alone with me

Am I the boy you dreamed of?
Living in your subconscious, oh
Do you believe in love?
And is it because of me?
Yeah, if it's up to me
Am I the boy you dreamed of?
Living in your subconscious, oh
Do you believe in love?
And is it because of me?
Yeah, if it's up to me
Say it all

Do you believe in love?
And is it because of me?
Yeah, if it's up to me
Say it all
